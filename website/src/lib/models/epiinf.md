## When should you use EpiInf?

- When you want to **jointly infer epidemic trajectories and model parameters** from sequence and case count data.
- When population sizes are small or uncertain, making **coalescent models inappropriate**.
- When combining **sequenced and unsequenced samples** to improve prevalence estimates.
- When studying **macroevolutionary dynamics**, such as species richness through time, using extant and fossil data.
- When exact inference is required under **stochastic compartmental models (SI, SIS, SIR)**.

EpiInf offers versatile and exact inference of epidemic trajectories and parameters using both genomic and case count data.
