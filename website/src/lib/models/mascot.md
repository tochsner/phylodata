## When should you use MASCOT?

- When you need **phylogeographic analysis** with more than multiple discrete locations or states
- When you want to **infer migration rates and effective population sizes** between sub-populations from genetic data
- When you need to **avoid biases** from discrete trait approximations that treat lineage movements independently
- When you want **ancestral state reconstruction** incorporating information from the entire phylogenetic tree

MASCOT offers a marginal approximation to the structured coalescent that integrates over migration histories without requiring MCMC sampling of ancestral states.
