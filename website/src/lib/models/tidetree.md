## When should you use TiDeTree?

Use TiDeTree when:
- Working with **genetic lineage tracing data** from single-cell experiments
- Need to infer **time-scaled single-cell phylogenies**
- Want to estimate **population dynamic parameters** (cell division, death, differentiation rates)
- Have **CRISPR-Cas9 editing** or **recombinase editing** experimental data

TiDeTree specifically addresses the challenges of inferring cellular phylogenies from lineage tracing data where genetic edits accumulate over time in a controlled experimental setting.
