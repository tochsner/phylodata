## When should you use GEO_SPHERE?

Use GEO_SPHERE when:
- Working with **global-scale phylogeography** covering large geographic areas
- Need **spherical diffusion models** that account for Earth's curvature
- Have **latitude-longitude coordinates** from worldwide sampling

GEO_SPHERE provides spherical diffusion models for phylogeographic analysis that properly account for the spherical nature of Earth.
