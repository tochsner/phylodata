## When should you use SNAPPER?

Use SNAPPER when:
- Have **unlinked biallelic markers** (like SNP or AFLP data) that are well-spaced and unlinked
- Working with **large datasets** (hundreds to thousands of individuals)
- Want to infer **species demographics** from genomic data
- Need **species delimitation**
- Need faster alternative to **SNAPP** for big datasets

SNAPPER is a faster alternative to SNAPP due to its diffusion model approach.
