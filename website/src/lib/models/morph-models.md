## When should you use morph-models?

Use Morph-Models when:
- Working with **discrete morphological characters** (anatomical, behavioral traits)
- Have **fossil data** with only morphological information available
- Need to combine **morphological and molecular data** in total evidence analyses

Morph-Models implements the Lewis MK and MKv models for Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of discrete morphological data.
