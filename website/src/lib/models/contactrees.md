## When should you use contacTrees?

* When studying **language evolution** while accounting for **contact and borrowing**.
* When conventional phylogenetic models give **biased tree estimates** due to ignored contact.
* When reconstructing **language family histories** with both vertical inheritance and horizontal transfer.
* When analyzing **cultural evolution** beyond languages (e.g., artifacts, beliefs) where contact plays a role.

contacTrees offers Bayesian phylogenetic inference with explicit modeling of contact events in language and cultural evolution.
