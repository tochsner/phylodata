## When should you use ClaDS?

- When you want to model **small progressive changes** in diversification rates across lineages
- When you need **lineage-specific birth and death rates** rather than assuming constant rates
- When rate heterogeneity is **widespread but subtle** rather than involving large exceptional shifts

ClaDS offers a birth-death model where each edge has its own rates sampled from parent rates via lognormal distribution.
