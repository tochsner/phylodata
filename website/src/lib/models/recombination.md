## When should you use Recombination?

- When studying **recombining pathogens** like coronaviruses where phylogenetic trees are inadequate
- When you need to **infer recombination networks** under the coalescent with a recombination model

Recombination offers Bayesian inference of recombination networks using MCMC sampling without approximations beyond the coalescent with recombination framework.
