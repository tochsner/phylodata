## When should you use BEAST Phylonco?

Use BEAST Phylonco when:
- Working with **single-cell cancer evolution** data
- Analyzing **mutations** in tumor phylogenies
- Need to account for **sequencing errors** in single-cell data
- Want to model **allelic dropout** and **amplification errors**

Phylonco specifically addresses the challenges of single-cell sequencing data where technical errors can significantly impact phylogenetic inference of cancer evolution.
