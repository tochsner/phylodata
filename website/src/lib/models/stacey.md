## When should you use STACEY?

- When you need **species delimitation without a priori species assignments** from multilocus data
- When you want **simultaneous species tree and delimitation inference** under the multispecies coalescent
- When you have **multiple gene loci** and want to avoid pipeline approaches that cause bias

Extension of *BEAST using birth-death-collapse prior and improved MCMC operators for efficient species delimitation.
