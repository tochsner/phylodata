## When should you use PIQMEE?

- Analyzing **datasets containing duplicate sequences** that slow down standard BEAST 2 analysis
- **Longitudinally sampled sequences** from one host infected by a pathogen causing chronic infection
- **Large datasets** where down-sampling leads to biased estimates or imprecise parameters

PIQMEE enables datasets as large as 20,000 sequences to be processed within a 10-day runtime when most are duplicates.
