## When should you use BASTA?

* When performing **phylogeographic inference** with more than a few populations.
* When **discrete trait models** give unreliable results due to biased sampling.
* When you need both **accuracy of the structured coalescent** and **computational efficiency**.
* When studying **origins and spread of outbreaks** across hosts or locations.

BASTA offers a scalable and reliable approximation to the structured coalescent for robust phylogeographic inference.
