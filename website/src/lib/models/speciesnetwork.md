## When should you use SpeciesNetwork?

Use SpeciesNetwork when:

- Studying **reticulate evolution** (hybridization, introgression, gene flow)
- Need to infer **phylogenetic networks** instead of simple trees
- Have **multilocus sequence data** with conflicting gene trees
- Working with closely related species showing **extensive hybridization**
- Need to account for both **incomplete lineage sorting** and **gene flow**

SpeciesNetwork uses the multispecies network coalescent to jointly infer species networks and embedded gene trees from sequence data.
