## When should you use PoMo (Polymorphism-aware phylogenetic models)?

* When accounting for **incomplete lineage sorting and ancestral polymorphisms**.
* When analyzing **genome-wide data** with multiple individuals per species.
* When estimating **mutation rates and fixation biases** across taxa.

PoMo offers a polymorphism-aware framework that jointly models mutations, fixation, and shared variation across species. It achieves this by modeling substitutions as mutational events followed by a gradual fixation process.
