## When should you use BEASTvntr?

- Model **variable number tandem repeats / microsatellite data** in bacterial or eukaryotic organisms
- Analysis where **mutational bias** and mutation rate proportionality need modeling
- Studies involving **multi-step mutations** in tandem repeat evolution

BEASTvntr implements the Sainudiin model to handle directional mutation patterns in VNTR and microsatellite data.
