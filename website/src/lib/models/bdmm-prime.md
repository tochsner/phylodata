## When should you use BDMM-Prime?

Use BDMM-Prime when:
- Working with **phylodynamic inference** under birth-death-sampling models
- Analyzing **epidemiological data** with structured populations (e.g., geographic locations, risk groups)
- Need **multi-type birth-death models** with migration between types
- Have **serially sampled data** (tip dates) from different locations/types
- Require **ancestral type reconstruction** (when/where lineage transitions occurred)
- Want to **jointly sample population histories** using particle filtering

BDMM-Prime excels at modeling pathogen transmission dynamics across geographic regions, host types, or epidemiological compartments.
