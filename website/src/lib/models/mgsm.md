## When should you use MGSM?

- When you suspect **lineage-specific rate variation** that leads to extreme differences in substitution rates between branches
- When **heterotachy** (rate variation at the same site across different lineages) may be causing errors in reconstructing evolutionary relationships
- When you want to improve **divergence time estimates** that may be biased by poorly characterized features of sequence evolution

MGSM allows gamma rate heterogeneity to change on branches, offering a more realistic model of sequence evolution with negligible computational cost.
