## When should you use StarBeast3?

Use StarBeast3 when:
- Working with **multilocus datasets** (multiple gene alignments)
- Need to account for **incomplete lineage sorting** between species and genes
- Want to infer **species trees** that differ from individual gene trees
- Have **multiple individuals per species** across different loci
- Require **multispecies coalescent (MSC)** modeling instead of concatenation
- Need to estimate **effective population sizes** for species lineages

StarBeast3 corrects statistical pitfalls of concatenation approaches and provides proper MSC inference with significant performance improvements over previous methods.
