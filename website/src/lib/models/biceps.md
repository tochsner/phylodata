## When should you use BICEPS?

Use BICEPS when:
- Inferring **population histories** from genetic data
- Require a more powerful alternative to **Bayesian skyline models**
- Need **efficient coalescent modeling** with better mixing
- Working with datasets where **population size changes** over time
- Want **flexible tree priors** that don't interfere with analyses

BICEPS provides efficient coalescent epoch modeling by integrating out population sizes and using smart tree operators.
