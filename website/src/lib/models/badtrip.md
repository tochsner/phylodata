## When should you use BadTrIP?

* When reconstructing **host-to-host transmission** during outbreaks.
* When leveraging **within-host pathogen variants** (low-frequency polymorphisms) for transmission inference.
* When accounting for **sequencing error and transmission bottlenecks** in the model.
* When **epidemiological data** is available to combine with genomic data.

BadTrIP offers realistic Bayesian inference of transmission trees using within-host variation and epidemiological information.
