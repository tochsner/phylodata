## When should you use sampled-ancestors?

- When you have **epidemiological data** where patients remain infectious after sampling
- When working with **fossil data** that may be direct ancestors
- When you need to **avoid parameter estimation bias** from unmodeled sampled ancestors
- When analyzing **serially sampled viral data** with dense sampling

Enables Bayesian inference of trees where sampled nodes can be direct ancestors using specialized MCMC operators.
