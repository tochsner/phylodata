## When should you use Babel?

Use Babel when:
- Working with **linguistic data** in BEAST2
- Analyzing **cognate data** (homologous word forms from common ancestors)
- Studying **grammatical features** across languages
- Creating **language phylogenies** with temporal information
- Working with **binary presence/absence data** for linguistic traits
- Need to account for **ascertainment bias** in linguistic datasets

Babel is designed for comparative linguistics and provides information about language relationships and tests hypotheses concerning the ages of language families.
