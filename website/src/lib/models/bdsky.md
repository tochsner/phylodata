## When should you use BDSKY?

Use BDSKY when:
- Analyzing **epidemiological data** to estimate **effective reproduction number (Re)**
- Need **skyline plots** showing how rates change over time
- Working with **infectious disease outbreaks** and transmission dynamics
- Have **serially sampled** or **contemporary sampling** data

BDSKY models population dynamics forward in time, making it ideal for understanding how transmission rates change during epidemics.
