## When should you use MSBD?

- When you need **lineage-specific birth and death rates** without knowing the driving trait
- When you want to **infer both the number and location** of evolutionary regimes across the phylogeny
- When **heterogeneous populations** show important rate differences that affect population dynamics estimates

MSBD offers a multitype birth-death model that estimates lineage-dependent diversification rates without requiring prior hypotheses about rate-driving traits.
