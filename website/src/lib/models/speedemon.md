## When should you use SPEEDEMON?

Use SPEEDEMON when:
- Need to **define species boundaries** from genomic data
- Working with **multilocus sequence data** or **SNP data**
- Want to account for **different evolutionary histories** across genomic regions
- Want to allow **speciation rates to vary through time**

SPEEDEMON uses the Yule-skyline collapse (YSC) model to cluster taxa into species when their divergence times fall below a threshold Îµ, while allowing diversification rates to change over time.
