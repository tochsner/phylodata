## When should you use CoalRe?

- When studying **segmented viruses** like influenza where genome segments can reassort during co-infection
- When you need to **infer reassortment networks** rather than assuming tree-like evolution
- When you want to **jointly analyze multiple segments** while accounting for reassortment events
- When **standard phylogenetic methods fail** because reassortment breaks tree assumptions

CoalRe offers coalescent-based modeling of joint coalescent and reassortment processes using MCMC sampling of networks and segment tree embeddings.
