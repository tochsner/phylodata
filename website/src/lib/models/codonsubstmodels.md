## When should you use codonSubstModels?

- When you want to **analyze protein-coding sequences** using the M0 (GY94) codon substitution model
- When you need to **estimate omega (dN/dS) ratios** to detect selection pressure on coding sequences
- When working with **codon alignments** and different genetic codes (universal, mitochondrial, etc.)

Codonsubstmodels offers codon substitution modeling that accounts for the genetic code structure.
