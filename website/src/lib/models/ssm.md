- When you need **standard time-reversible substitution models** including JC, F81, K80, HKY, TrNf, TrN, TPM1, TPM1f, TPM2, TPM2f, TPM3, TPM3f, TIM1, TIM1f, TIM2, TIM2f, TIM3, TIM3f, TVMf, TVM, SYM, and GTR
- When working with **nucleotide alignments** in BEAUti and need to select from the standard models via the substitution models dropdown

Provides all standard nucleotide substitution models with Dirichlet priors for rates and frequencies.
