## When should you use OBAMA?

Use OBAMA when:
- Working with **amino acid/protein alignments** (not nucleotides)
- You want to **avoid committing to one substitution model**
- Site model selection isn't your main focus
- You prefer to **integrate out model uncertainty** during MCMC

OBAMA averages across multiple empirical amino acid models (WAG, LG, BLOSSOM, etc.) rather than forcing you to choose just one.
