## When should you use break-away?

Use break-away when:
- Studying **founder-dispersal scenarios** where one population stays, one migrates
- Need alternative to **diffusion-based models** that assume migration on both branches
- Want to model **asymmetric migration** patterns

break-away models phylogeography where at each tree split, one population remains stationary while the other disperses to a new location.
