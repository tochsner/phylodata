## When should you use SNAPP?

Use SNAPP when:
- Have **unlinked biallelic markers** (like SNP or AFLP data) that are well-spaced and unlinked
- Need **full coalescent models** without explicit gene tree sampling
- Want to infer **species demographics** from genomic data
- Need **species delimitation**

SNAPP integrates over all possible gene trees using a novel algorithm, making it efficient for species tree inference from independent biallelic markers.
