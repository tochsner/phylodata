## When should you use the Gamma Spike Model?

Use the Gamma Spike Model when:
- You want to **test for punctuated equilibrium** in evolutionary data
- You suspect **evolution is accelerated at the time of branching**
- You want to account for both gradual evolution and abrupt evolutionary bursts
- You prefer **model averaging** over committing to one clock model
- You have temporal information (tip dates, node calibrations) in your data

The model tests whether evolution follows `distance = rate Ã— length + spike`, where spikes represent instantaneous bursts of evolution at branching events.
