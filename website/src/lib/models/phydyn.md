## When should you use PhyDyn?

- When performing **phylodynamic inference** by fitting compartmental epidemiological models directly to sequence data.
- When estimating **reproduction numbers, epidemic curves, and population dynamics** from genetic data.
- When you need a **flexible structured coalescent framework** for demographic or epidemiological processes.
- When analyzing **infectious disease outbreaks** such as Ebola or influenza.

PhyDyn offers a powerful and flexible coalescent-based framework for joint inference of phylogenies and epidemiological dynamics.
