## When should you use Contraband?

Use Contraband when:
- Analyzing **continuous trait evolution** along phylogenies
- Need **Brownian motion models** for trait data
- Want to **jointly estimate** phylogeny and trait evolution
- Working with **morphological or ecological traits**

Contraband provides Bayesian inference for continuous traits using Brownian models while simultaneously estimating species relationships and divergence times.
