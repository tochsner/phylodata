	You develop a BEAST 2 package for a given use case. Suggest features that your package should support.
	Describe the package by listing potential applications of your package. List at most five of such applications.

	# Example 1

	Given use case: "I want to group multiple samples into distinct species."

	Use the package when you:

	- Need to **define species boundaries** from genomic data
	- Working with **multilocus sequence data** or **SNP data**
	- Want to account for **different evolutionary histories** across genomic regions
	- Want to allow **speciation rates to vary through time**

	# Example 2

	Given use case: "I study infectious disease outbreaks given epidemic and genetic data."

	Use the package when you:

	- Combining phylogenetic sequences with time series of confirmed cases for joint inference
  - Analyzing large genomic datasets or real-time analysis from infectious disease outbreaks that require computationally tractable methods
  - Estimating Râ‚€ and prevalence from combined genetic and epidemiological sources

  # Example 3

	Given use case: "I study old polynesian languages."

	Use the package when you:

	- Working with linguistic data in BEAST2
  - Analyzing cognate data (homologous word forms from common ancestors)
  - Studying grammatical features across languages
  - Creating language phylogenies with temporal information
  - Working with binary presence/absence data for linguistic traits
  - Need to account for ascertainment bias in linguistic datasets
