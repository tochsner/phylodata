# ðŸ§¬ PhyloData

PhyloData is a repository for Bayesian Phylogenetic experiments.

[Check out](PRINCIPLES.md) the draft of the core pinciples and vision behind PhyloData.

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

PhyloData helps you to:

- Make your BEAST 2 experiments available in a standardized way.
- Discover experiments performed by other researchers.
- As a method developer, test your methods on a variety of real-world datasets.

The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Website**: A user-friendly web interface for visualization and sharing
2. **Python**: A python library to prepare your experiment for upload and to access the data
3. **Java**: A java library to access the data

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Python Library

See the [Python README](./python/README.md) and check out the [documentation](https://phylodata.com/docs/python_first_steps).

### Java Library

See the [Java README](./java/README.md) and check out the [documentation](https://phylodata.com/docs/java_first_steps).

### Website

Visit [phylodata.com](https://phylodata.com).

## ðŸ‘¥ Contributing

Right now, PhyloData is in its early stages of development and not yet a fully functional platform.

You can help by trying to upload your own phylogenetic datasets to PhyloData. If you run into issues with the upload process, feel free to [send me your BEAST 2 XML files directly](mailto:tobia.ochsner@hotmail.com).

For those interested in contributing to development - while formal collaboration and development processes like issue tracking and CI/CD are still being established - please [reach out directly to discuss how you can help improve PhyloData](mailto:tobia.ochsner@hotmail.com).
